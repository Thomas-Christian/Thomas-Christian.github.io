            <div class="artifact-narrative">
              <p> 
The artifact, "Weight Logger," is an Android application designed for tracking weight over time. It includes user authentication, weight management, goal setting, progress visualization, and statistical analysis. Initially developed in CS-360 (Jan–Mar), the application underwent significant enhancements to improve its structure, maintainability, and security. The most notable improvement was the implementation of the MVVM architectural pattern, which introduced better separation of concerns and improved the app’s scalability.

This artifact was selected for inclusion in my ePortfolio because it effectively demonstrates my ability to design and implement a complete software solution while incorporating industry best practices. It highlights my proficiency in software engineering through its structured architecture and use of modern Android development techniques, such as LiveData for reactive UI updates and the repository pattern for data abstraction. The artifact also showcases algorithmic principles in features like password strength evaluation, weight trend analysis, and statistical calculations. Security enhancements, including the use of salted SHA-256 password hashing, input validation, and secure credential storage, reflect a strong understanding of secure software development practices.

The enhancements aligned with the Computer Science program outcomes by strengthening my ability to design well-structured, maintainable software solutions and apply advanced computing techniques. The improvements in UI design and data visualization refined my ability to create professional-quality visual communications, making complex data more accessible to users. The restructuring of validation logic into a centralized service reinforced my understanding of clean architecture principles and the importance of modular, reusable code.

Throughout the enhancement process, I gained a deeper appreciation for the trade-offs involved in software design. Refining the progress visualization required careful consideration of how to present data in a way that was both technically accurate and easy to interpret. Security improvements further reinforced the need to balance strong protection mechanisms with a seamless user experience. One of the biggest challenges was ensuring data consistency across multiple fragments, which I addressed using the observer pattern with LiveData. This experience deepened my understanding of proper state management in multi-view applications and helped me develop strategies for maintaining data integrity.

              <p> 
The artifact I've selected is an Animal Rescue Management System, originally developed in IT 145 (Jan - Mar 2024). This Java application was designed to track rescue animals (dogs and monkeys), manage their training status, and handle reservations. The original version used simple ArrayLists to store animal records and implemented basic CRUD operations with linear search algorithms.The enhanced version transforms the system with advanced data structures and algorithms that significantly improve efficiency, functionality, and scalability.

I selected this artifact because it demonstrates my ability to apply computer science concepts to solve real-world problems. The enhanced system uses multiple data structures including HashMap-based indexing for O(1) lookups and binary search for ordered collections. This shows my understanding of selecting appropriate data structures to optimize performance. I implemented several advanced algorithms including Levenshtein distance for fuzzy name matching, binary search for date-range queries, and multi-criteria search with optimized filtering. These enhancements demonstrate my ability to design efficient algorithms tailored to specific requirements. Lastly, the improved system follows object-oriented principles with a well-designed class hierarchy, appropriate encapsulation, and inheritance.

The enhancements align with the planned course outcomes: Outcome #3 “Design and evaluate computing solutions that solve a given problem using algorithmic principles and computer science practices”, and Outcome #4 “Demonstrate professional communication in the computer science field.” The implementation of HashMap-based indexing and advanced search algorithms demonstrates my ability to apply algorithmic principles to solve data retrieval problems efficiently. The enhanced system also demonstrates professional coding practices, clean design, and well-organized structure. The code includes comprehensive documentation with descriptive comments explaining the purpose and functionality of each component.

One of the most valuable aspects of this process was critically evaluating different data structures based on their time complexity. While an ArrayList is simple to implement, it becomes inefficient as data scales. Replacing it with HashMap-based indexing for O(1) lookups made me appreciate how the right data structure can dramatically improve performance. I faced several challenges during the enhancement process. The most significant was maintaining compatibility with the original functionality while implementing advanced features. I had to carefully refactor code to ensure that existing operations continued to work correctly. This experience taught me the value of incremental changes and thorough testing when enhancing existing systems. Another challenge was balancing sophistication with usability. While I could have implemented even more complex algorithms, I chose to focus on enhancements that provided tangible benefits to users. This reinforced the importance of keeping the end-user in mind when designing software solutions.

Through this artifact enhancement, I've gained a deeper understanding of how theoretical concepts in algorithms and data structures apply to practical software development. I've learned to look beyond the immediate functionality and consider performance, scalability, and maintainability—skills that will serve me well throughout my computer science career.

The artifact I've selected is an Animal Shelter Dashboard, originally developed as a python/mongo application with basic functionality for displaying and filtering animal data. The original version used a simple data presentation and limited visualization capabilities. My enhanced version transforms the system with a modern UI framework that significantly improves visual coherence, user experience, and overall system usability. While not implemented just yet, I also plan to add comprehensive security measures for data, and buff up the database. 

I selected this artifact because it demonstrates my ability to apply modern development techniques to create interfaces that effectively communicate data and support organizational decision-making. The enhanced dashboard uses components that provide a consistent design language, improved accessibility, and responsive layouts that work across different device sizes. 

The enhancements align with several course outcomes. For Outcome #1, the improved interface creates a collaborative environment that makes data more accessible, supporting better organizational decision-making. The clean, intuitive design allows staff with varying technical abilities to quickly filter and analyze animal data. For Outcome #2, the enhanced visual design delivers professional-quality visual communications that are coherent and appropriately adapted to the specific context. For Outcome #4, my use of Material UI demonstrates the ability to leverage industry-standard tools that deliver value, resulting in a more maintainable codebase and a more professional user experience.

One of the most valuable aspects of this process was critically evaluating different frameworks based on their component libraries, accessibility features, and integration capabilities. I faced several challenges during the enhancement process. The most significant was adapting the existing application structure to incorporate the new component library while maintaining full functionality. This experience taught me the importance of understanding component lifecycles and state management. Another challenge was ensuring the enhanced interface remained intuitive while adding visual sophistication. I had to carefully consider how each design decision would impact usability. This reinforced the importance of keeping user needs at the center of design decisions.

Through this artifact enhancement, I've gained a deeper understanding of how modern frameworks and technologies can be leveraged to create interfaces that not only look professional but also improve information access and decision-making.
